# GoggleClips

GoogleClips are 3D printable clips that improve the fit of NHS-provided PPE goggles(shown below).

The goggles, as provided, have a tendancy to fall of the face of the wearer especially when they look down. These clips reinforce the joint in the leg of the goggles that improves their fit.

The clips are designed to be single use and should be disposed of with the goggles they are attached to. Over 3000 of the clips have been manufactured and distributed to healthcare staff in NHS Highland with many being used in Skye and Lochalsh.

## Ordering

Any healthcare professional in Scotland can order clips here -> https://forms.gle/yvxxf9eWfUMuvDma9 Production is limited to 300 a day and a contribution for postage and material costs would be greatly appreciated. It is my intention that any contributions will be donated to my local schools. Preferably if you have access to a 3d printer the stl file is included in this repo. 

## Attaching Clips

This video shows the basic idea (https://youtu.be/92u9Z6GJIE8). WARNING it is very boring.

This video explains how to attach the clips on to the goggles (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3ka8afu0U).

## Print Settings

These settings are known to work on Prusa i3 Mk3 printers.

Material: PLA (PETG is known not to work).

Layer Height: 0.3 mm
Perimeters: 2
Top/Bottom Layers: 2
Infill: +5%

For your initial prototype try squeezing the two walls of the clip, they should withstand a high degree of force.

## Donating prints to NHS

Firstly talk to your local healthcare professionals about their needs and if they need your help. I recommend that you read through https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/ to get an idea of measures you can take to limit the risk of spreading Covid19 through 3D printing. Your local healthcare professionals may have guidleines for you to follow. Please consider that your local healthcare professionals may be rather busy and may not be able to accept your help. 

This design has not been formally approved but I have been in contact with NHS Highland Procurement regarding the provision of the clips to my local healthcare professionals.
